## 🧠 Vadodara Smart Traffic AI  
### Built by Independent Developer Jayvir

#### 🚦 About the Project  
This is an advanced AI-powered traffic control and number plate recognition system built specifically for Indian urban junctions. Unlike conventional ANPR tools, this project combines:

- **YOLOv8 for real-time vehicle and plate detection**
- **CRNN OCR model** trained on Indian license plates
- **DeepSORT tracking** to link vehicles and plates across frames
- **Dynamic signal control logic** based on live traffic density
- **Accident detection system** that identifies potential collisions and notifies authorities in real time

#### 🎯 Goals  
- Improve traffic flow and reduce congestion using AI decisions  
- Automate plate recognition for enforcement and analytics  
- Detect and report accidents for faster emergency response  
- Integrate with municipal junctions for smart city deployment  

#### ✅ Key Features  

| Module                  | Functionality                                                |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vehicle Detection       | YOLOv8 model optimized for Indian traffic                   |
| Plate Detection         | Retrained YOLO model for regional plates                    |
| OCR Recognition         | CRNN model fine-tuned for Hindi/Gujarati                    |
| Object Tracking         | DeepSORT to assign IDs and maintain history                 |
| Signal Control          | Lane-based green time assignment                            |
| Accident Detection      | Motion and collision-based triggers with real-time alerts   |
| Future Expansion        | Emergency vehicle detection, zone awareness                 |

#### 🔒 Technology Licensing  
This system is intended for commercial deployment. Licensing steps are in progress with Ultralytics for YOLOv8 integration in a closed-source product.

#### 📽️ Real-World Footage  
Thanks to coordination with Vadodara City authorities, this system will soon be trained and validated using actual traffic junction footage collected from municipal infrastructure.
